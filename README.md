## Here's a readme
I stole a lot of this from github user `josean-dev`
    - https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files/tree/main/.config/nvim
Thanks Josean! (check him out on YouTube as well, https://www.youtube.com/@joseanmartinez)
Feel free to make changes as you see fit.

## Setup and usage
- Clone the code into w/e root folder you need your config to be in.
- Rename the "rocky" bits to whatever you want.
- Use `nvim .` in that directory to open up your netrw.
- Lazy should take over and install everything you need.
- Lsp items have yet to be tested by me thoroughly.
